           <h1 class="title">What is different about SpaceX?</h1> 
           <p class="text">Well, SpaceX is a privately owned company founded by Elon Musk, the highly revered private space entrepreneur. 
               NASA, on the other hand, is a government-owned and funded organization. ... 
               And the company launches both commercial and military satellites for its clients. 
               So, that's the difference between SpaceX and NASA.</p>

               <p> People who want to visit it can go to the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Jack Northrop Avenue. 
                The sidewalk is "pretty close right there," a SpaceX spokesman said in an email â€” but "no, you can't touch it."</p>
